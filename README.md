HEART ATTACK  ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION 

Abstract:
              Cardiovascular disease is one of the most fatal conditions in the present world. A study shows that from 1990 to 2016 the death rate due to heart diseases  have increased around 34 percent from 155.7 to 209.1 deaths per one lakh population in India. Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

Problem Statement:
        A dataset is formed by taking into consideration some of the information of 303 individuals. The problem is  based on the given information about each individual we have to calculate that whether that individual will suffer from heart disease.

Software and Hardware used:
Software: 
Programming  language : python
Tool used: Jupyter Notebook

Data Set:
 The dataset consists of 14 features , the features used are :
1. Age : displays the age of the individual.

2. Sex : displays the gender of the individual using the following format: 1=male,0=female.

3. Chest-pain type : displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the  following format : 1 = typical angina 2 = atypical angina 3 = non - anginal pain 4 = asymptotic

4.Resting Blood Pressure : displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)

5.Serum Cholestrol : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)

6.Fasting Blood Sugar : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 (true) else : 0 (false)

7.Resting ECG : 0 = normal 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy

8.Max heart rate achieved : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.

9.Exercise induced angina : 1 = yes 0 = no

10.ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest : displays the value which is integer or float.

11.Peak exercise ST segment : 1 = upsloping 2 = flat 3 = downsloping

12.Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.

13.Thal : displays the thalassemia : 3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversable defect

14.Diagnosis of heart disease : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart  disease or not : 0 = absence 1,2,3,4 = present.
